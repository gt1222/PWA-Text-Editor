# PWA-Text-Editor

I thought it was a simple assignment but the only part I was able to do was the manijest file. The service worker and idb took a long time for me to figure out. Wait, it turns out, I missed a whole folder to work on.


## Installation
1. git clone repository
2. npm install packages
3. npm run start would run build and run node server.js
